This repository documents my learning journey in AI/Machine Learning, including projects, notes, and exercises completed in order to become competent in Computer Vision.

I aim to become well versed in computer vision techniques through practice projects focusing on:
1. The basics of image processing & CNNs
2. Image classification projects
3. Object detection & dataset handling
4. Segmentation & performance tuning
5. Real-world deployment + capstone project
